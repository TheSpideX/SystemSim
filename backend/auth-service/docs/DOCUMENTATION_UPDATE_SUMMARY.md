- ✅ Updated test skipping behavior documentation

### 2. HTTP/2-Specific Documentation

#### `docs/HTTP2_UPGRADE.md`
- ✅ Already correctly documents the upgrade from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2
- ✅ Contains appropriate historical references to HTTP/1.1

#### `docs/FRONTEND_HTTP2_INTEGRATION.md`
- ✅ Already correctly documents HTTP/2-only requirements
- ✅ Contains appropriate references to no HTTP/1.1 fallback

### 3. Main README

#### `README.md`
- ✅ Already updated with HTTP/2 references
- ✅ No HTTP/1.1 or old port references found

## Key Changes Made

### Port Updates
- **HTTP/2 Port**: 8001 → 9001 (with TLS)
- **gRPC Port**: 9001 → 9000
- **Protocol**: HTTP → HTTPS with HTTP/2

### URL Updates
- **Base URLs**: `http://localhost:8001` → `https://localhost:9001`
- **Health Checks**: `http://localhost:8001/health` → `https://localhost:9001/health`
- **Metrics**: `http://localhost:8001/metrics` → `https://localhost:9001/metrics`

### Command Updates
- **curl Commands**: Added `-k --http2` flags for HTTP/2 with self-signed certificates
- **gRPC Commands**: Updated port from 9001 to 9000

### Configuration Updates
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `AUTH_SERVICE_HTTP_URL` → `AUTH_SERVICE_HTTP2_URL`
  - `AUTH_SERVICE_GRPC_URL` port updated
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Updated port mappings and service configurations

## Verification

All documentation now consistently reflects:

1. ✅ **HTTP/2-Only Operation**: No HTTP/1.1 references except in upgrade documentation
2. ✅ **Correct Ports**: 9001 for HTTP/2, 9000 for gRPC
3. ✅ **HTTPS URLs**: All client-facing URLs use HTTPS
4. ✅ **TLS Requirements**: Documentation mentions certificate handling
5. ✅ **HTTP/2 Commands**: All curl examples use `--http2` flag
6. ✅ **Self-Signed Certificates**: Development commands use `-k` flag

## Files Not Requiring Updates

The following files were checked and found to be already correct or not requiring updates:

- `docs/GRPC_API_REFERENCE.md` - No HTTP/port references
- `docs/SERVICE_INTEGRATION.md` - gRPC-focused, no HTTP references
- Various internal code files - Already updated during implementation

## Impact on Users

### For Developers
- Must update client code to use HTTPS with port 9001
- Must handle self-signed certificates in development
- Must use HTTP/2-compatible clients

### For DevOps
- Must update deployment configurations for new ports
- Must update monitoring and health check URLs
- Must configure TLS certificates for production

### For API Consumers
- Must update API base URLs from HTTP to HTTPS
- Must update port from 8001 to 9001
- Must ensure HTTP/2 client support

## Summary

All documentation has been successfully updated to reflect the auth microservice's strict HTTP/2-only operation. The documentation now provides consistent guidance for:

- HTTP/2-only client integration
- Proper port usage (9001 for HTTP/2, 9000 for gRPC)
- TLS certificate handling
- Development and production deployment
- Troubleshooting HTTP/2 connections

The upgrade is fully documented and ready for production use.
