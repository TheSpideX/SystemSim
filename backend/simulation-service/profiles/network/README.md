```go
type NetworkTopology struct {
    Nodes map[string]*NetworkNode
    Edges map[string]*NetworkEdge
}

type NetworkEdge struct {
    SourceNodeID  string
    TargetNodeID  string
    DistanceKm    float64  // Real physical distance
    BaseLatencyMs float64  // Real measured latency
    BandwidthMbps int      // Edge bandwidth capacity
    HopCount      int      // Network hops
    EdgeType      string   // "fiber", "satellite", "wireless"
