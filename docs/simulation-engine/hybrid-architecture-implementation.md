# Adaptive Tick-Based Architecture Implementation Guide

## Overview

The simulation engine implements a **hardware-adaptive tick-based architecture** that automatically calculates optimal tick duration based on system scale and hardware capabilities, providing optimal performance from small educational systems to massive enterprise simulations.

## Single Unified Architecture

### Goroutine-Based Engine Architecture (All Scales)

**Core Principle**: Each engine gets its own goroutine for maximum parallelism and deterministic behavior
**Scalability**: Unlimited components with hardware-adaptive tick duration

├── Direct inter-engine communication via channels
├── Component instance tracks all engine goroutines
├── True parallel processing within components
└── Immediate response to operations

Goroutine Distribution:
├── CPU Engine: 1 goroutine per component
├── Memory Engine: 1 goroutine per component
├── Storage Engine: 1 goroutine per component (if present)
├── Network Input Engine: 1 goroutine per component
├── Network Output Engine: 1 goroutine per component
└── Coordination Engine: 1 goroutine per component

Total: Up to 6 goroutines per component
Scalability: Unlimited components (hardware-constrained only)
```

#### **Hardware-Adaptive Performance**
```

```

## Hardware-Adaptive Tick Duration System

### Automatic Tick Calculation

**Core Innovation**: System automatically measures hardware performance and calculates optimal tick duration with safety margins

#### **Hardware Detection Process**
```
Calibration Steps:
1. Detect CPU cores and memory capacity
2. Create test component set (10% of target scale)
3. Measure actual processing time for test tick
4. Extrapolate to full system scale
5. Apply safety multiplier (5-10x)
6. Round to reasonable tick duration
7. Monitor and adjust during runtime

Hardware Factors:
├── CPU Core Count: Parallel processing capacity
├── Memory Capacity: Goroutine memory limits
├── Context Switch Rate: OS scheduling efficiency
├── Current System Load: Available resources
└── Component Count: Total goroutines needed
```

#### **Adaptive Tick Duration Calculation**
```
Tick Duration Formula:
1. Measure processing time for current goroutine count
2. Apply adaptive safety multiplier based on scale and hardware:
   - Small (1-1,000): 2x safety margin
   - Medium (1,001-10,000): 3x safety margin
   - Large (10,001-100,000): 5x safety margin
   - Massive (100,001+): Hardware-adaptive safety margin
     * 128+ cores: 5x safety (high-end hardware)
     * 64+ cores: 7x safety (mid-range hardware)
     * <64 cores: 10x safety (lower-end hardware)
3. Round to reasonable values (1ms, 10ms, 100ms, 1s, 10s)

Example Calculations by Hardware:
├── 1,000 components (6K goroutines):
│   ├── 8-core: 1.3ms base → 5ms tick
│   ├── 16-core: 0.65ms base → 1ms tick
│   └── 32+ core: 0.3ms base → 1ms tick
├── 10,000 components (60K goroutines):
│   ├── 8-core: 13ms base → 50ms tick
│   ├── 16-core: 6.5ms base → 20ms tick
│   └── 32+ core: 3ms base → 10ms tick
├── 100,000 components (600K goroutines):
│   ├── 8-core: 128ms base → 2s tick
│   ├── 16-core: 64ms base → 1s tick
│   └── 64+ core: 16ms base → 200ms tick
└── 1,000,000 components (6M goroutines):
    ├── 8-core: 1.28s base × 10x → 10s+ tick (not recommended)
    ├── 16-core: 640ms base × 10x → 10s tick (slow)
    ├── 64-core: 160ms base × 7x → 1s tick (improved)
    └── 128+ core: 80ms base × 5x → 500ms tick (optimal)
```

### Runtime Monitoring and Adjustment

#### **Performance Monitoring**
```
Real-time Metrics:
├── Actual tick processing time vs target

Adjustment Triggers:
├── Processing time exceeds 80% of tick duration
├── CPU utilization above 80%
├── Memory usage approaching limits
├── Consistent tick deadline misses
└── User-reported performance issues
```

    // Engine goroutine tracking (all scales)
