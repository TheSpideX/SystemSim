## Profile-Based Reality Grounding

### Hardware Profile System
Instead of arbitrary parameters, all simulation behavior is grounded in **real hardware specifications**:

#### CPU Profiles (Real Hardware)
- **Intel Xeon Gold 6248R**: 24 cores, 3.0-4.0 GHz, 35.75MB L3 cache, 205W TDP
- **AMD EPYC 7742**: 64 cores, 2.25-3.4 GHz, 256MB L3 cache, 225W TDP

- **DDR5-4800**: 4800 MHz, CL40, 38.4 GB/s per channel
- **HBM2**: 1000 MHz, 256 GB/s bandwidth

#### Storage Profiles (Real Hardware)
- **Samsung 980 PRO**: 1M IOPS, 7GB/s read, 68μs latency
- **Intel Optane**: 550K IOPS, 2.5GB/s read, 10μs latency
- **WD Black HDD**: 180 IOPS, 250MB/s read, 8ms latency

- **Cisco Catalyst 9300**: 48x1Gbps, 208Gbps backplane, 2μs latency
- **Mellanox ConnectX-6**: 2x100Gbps, 500ns latency, hardware offload

### Workload Profile System
Cache behavior and performance patterns are based on **real workload characteristics**:

#### Web Server Workload
- **Cache locality**: High (92% convergence point)
- **Access patterns**: Sequential with high temporal locality
- **Variance**: Low (±5%) due to predictable request patterns

#### Database OLTP Workload
- **Cache locality**: Moderate (75% convergence point)
- **Access patterns**: Mixed random/sequential with moderate locality
- **Variance**: Medium (±8%) due to query pattern diversity

#### Analytics Workload
- **Cache locality**: Poor (45% convergence point)
- **Access patterns**: Large sequential scans with poor temporal locality
- **Variance**: High (±12%) due to data-dependent access patterns

### Physics-Based Thermal Modeling
Thermal behavior uses **real physics equations** with hardware specifications:

```
Heat Generation = CPU Load × Heat Generation Rate (from CPU specs)
Cooling Capacity = Cooler Rating × Cooling Efficiency (from cooler specs)
Temperature Rise = (Heat - Cooling) / Thermal Mass × Time
Throttling = if Temperature > Throttle Point (from CPU specs)
```

**Example**: Intel Xeon 6248R with 250W cooler
- Heat generation: 1.2W per % CPU load
- Cooling capacity: 250W × 95% efficiency = 237.5W
- At 90% load: 108W heat generated
- Net cooling: 237.5W - 108W = 129.5W excess (no throttling)
- At 100% load for 60 seconds: Thermal mass determines temperature rise

## What We ARE Simulating (Predictable Behaviors)

### Hardware Profile-Constrained Behaviors
We simulate behaviors using **real hardware specifications** from manufacturer datasheets:
- **CPU performance**: Intel/AMD specifications, workload-specific cache patterns, physics-based thermal behavior
- **Memory behavior**: DDR4/DDR5 specifications, language-specific GC behavior, memory controller characteristics
- **Storage performance**: Samsung/Intel/WD specifications, technology differences with real IOPS/latency values
- **Network performance**: Cisco/Mellanox specifications, protocol overhead from RFCs, speed-of-light latency

### Software Performance Patterns
We simulate software behaviors that follow predictable patterns:
- **Framework overhead**: Express.js vs Django vs Spring performance differences
- **Language performance**: Python vs Go vs Java execution speed multipliers
- **Algorithm complexity**: O(1) vs O(log n) vs O(n²) scaling behavior
- **Database query patterns**: Index lookup vs table scan vs join performance

### System-Level Behaviors
We simulate system interactions that follow engineering principles:
- **Load balancing**: Health-based routing, failover behavior
- **Auto-scaling**: Instance addition/removal based on load thresholds
- **Backpressure**: Queue buildup and natural flow control
- **Cascade failures**: How one component failure affects others

### Controlled Failure Scenarios
We support controlled failure injection for resilience testing:
- **Component failures**: "What happens if database instance fails?"
- **Network partitions**: "What happens if datacenter connection is lost?"
- **Resource exhaustion**: "What happens when memory/CPU/storage hits 100%?"
- **Load spikes**: "What happens with 10x sudden traffic increase?"

**Rationale**: These behaviors are predictable because they follow physics laws, hardware specifications, and engineering principles that can be modeled with statistical accuracy.

## What We DON'T Simulate (Unpredictable Behaviors)

### Human Errors and Operational Mistakes
- Configuration errors
- Deployment mistakes
- Manual intervention failures
- Process violations

### Random Hardware Failures
- Disk crashes
- Memory corruption
- Power outages
- Network cable disconnections

### External Dependencies
- Third-party service outages
- Internet connectivity issues
- DNS resolution failures
- Certificate expiration

### Software Bugs and Edge Cases
- Memory leaks
- Race conditions
- Null pointer exceptions
- Logic errors in application code

**Rationale**: These behaviors are unpredictable and don't follow statistical patterns. Our focus is on physics-constrained, engineering-predictable behaviors that can be modeled with high accuracy.

**Note**: While we don't simulate these as random events, we DO support **controlled failure injection** for testing system resilience.
